Cron.d & Cron Job 

In this script, we first define the cron job entry as a string variable, including the user root before the script path. We then use the echo command along with sudo tee to append the cron job entry to the file /etc/cron.d/patch-management. 

The sudo command is used to gain the necessary permissions to write to the /etc/cron.d directory.

Lastly, we set the appropriate permissions for the cron job file using sudo chmod 644 to ensure it has the required read and write permissions for the system.

Remember to grant executable permissions to the script using the command chmod +x scriptname.sh, where scriptname.sh is the name you choose for your bash script file.

Running this script with root privileges will automatically add the specified cron job to the /etc/cron.d/patch-management file, ensuring that the patch-management.sh script runs every 5 minutes as desired.

The tee command and the >> (append) operator serve similar purposes of writing output to a file, but they have some differences in their functionality.

Output Handling:

tee: The tee command reads input from standard input (stdin) and writes it to both the standard output (stdout) and the specified file(s). It allows you to split the output, sending it to multiple destinations simultaneously.
>> (append): The >> operator appends output to the specified file. It is typically used to redirect the stdout or stderr streams to a file, without displaying the output on the terminal.
File Creation:

tee: When using tee, if the specified file does not exist, it will be created. If the file already exists, it will be truncated and overwritten unless you use the -a option (tee -a) to append the output.
>> (append): The >> operator appends output to an existing file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
Flexibility:

tee: The tee command provides more flexibility as it allows you to redirect output to multiple files or commands, or a combination of both, simultaneously. This can be useful in various scenarios where you need to capture and process output in multiple ways.
>> (append): The >> operator is simpler and more straightforward, as it only appends output to a single file.
In summary, tee is more versatile and allows you to split and redirect output to multiple destinations, while the >> operator is primarily used for appending output to a single file.
